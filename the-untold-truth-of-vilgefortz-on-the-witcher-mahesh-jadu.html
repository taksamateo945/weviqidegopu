His parents come from India: his mother was born in Gorakhpur, and his father in Kashmir. They also lived in the Republic of Mauritius, but then moved to Australia. Mahesh had never dreamt of becoming an actor, being a very active kid, who was keen on sports and other physical activities. Mahesh has been a vegetarian since his early years. He also liked playing various musical instruments, and enjoyed music very much.</p><h2><span id=Educational_background>Educational background</span></h2><p>Mahesh matriculated from his local high school in Perth in 2000, but didn’t enroll at any college, as he had to work a lot and help his family to pay the bills.</p><h2><span id=Career>Career</span></h2><h3><span id=First_steps_in_the_acting_career>First steps in the acting career</span></h3><p>Mahesh once shared that he played poker to get money for his family and himself, but then he met Lou Mitchell a casting director, who invited Mahesh for an audition, and Mahesh got his first minor role of a student in his first movie “Sorry Bhai!” (2008). Mahesh was also invited to become a composer for the Australian show “Byte Me!”. From 2010 to 2011 Mahesh played the role of Dr. Doug Harris in the “Neighbours” series (1985 – present), a very popular Australian soap opera with more than 8,200 episodes aired.</p><p>Mahesh was invited to appear in the series by the same Lou Mitchell, so Mahesh signed a contract for six months at once, and landed the role of a doctor who worked at Erinsborough hospital. Mahesh was very convincing in his performance, so the producers renewed the contract with him for more episodes, and in total Mahesh appeared in 33 episodes.</p><h3><span id=Further_success>Further success</span></h3><p>In 2011 Mahesh landed the role of Vjay in “Taj”, and then got the role of Nasir Khan in the movie entitled “The Three Ages of Sasha” (2011). He also landed minor roles in such series as “Winners & Losers” (2010 – 2011), “Better Man” (2013) and “Two Fists, One Heart” (2008). He was then cast in the fantasy action movie “I, Frankenstein” (2013), in which he played the role of Ophir.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographypedia.org///biographypedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/9dd958ff6fbea447f9a14e22eef1b8c2-700x1024.jpg></p><p>In 2014 Mahesh joined the cast of the Netflix series “Marco Polo” (2014 – 2016), portraying the character of Ahmad. Mahesh shared in one of his <u><a rel=nofollow href=#>interviews </a></u>that the story of his character was very clear for him, as he grew up as an immigrant child, making his way in a strange country.</p><p>In 2016 Mahesh had a minor role in “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales”, but when the filming started, he broke the bridge of his nose during an action scene – one of his fellow-actors injured him with a sword, so Mahesh’s role was reduced dramatically because of his trauma. Later Mahesh had more episodic roles in such projects as “Judi Dench is Cool in Person” (short documentary movie), “Emerald Way” (2018) and “Submit Tweet” (2019).</p><h3><span id=Vilgefortz_in_The_Witcher_series>Vilgefortz in “The Witcher” series</span></h3><p>In 2019 Mahesh landed the role of Vilgefortz, a powerful sorcerer, in the new Netflix series “The Witcher”. Mahesh appeared in two episodes of the first season of the show: “Before a Fall” and “Much More”. The character of Vilgefortz of Roggeveen is quite contradictory. Being the head of Chapter of Sorcerers, he developed intrigues with Emhyr, the Emperor of Nilfgaard, seeking unlimited power over the North. Tracing Ciri, he lost her when she ran from him through the portal, which exploded after Ciri stepped in, and burned Vilgefortz’s face, so he lost his left eye.</p><p>Vilgefortz was also described as a very talented magician, easily igniting his enemies and performing complicated illusions. The author of the book series, Andrzej Sapkowski, described him as ‘fiendishly handsome’ and ‘young’ (which by all means referred to any sorcerers who were up to 100 years old), looking like he was around 35. Mahesh felt quite comfortable playing Vilgefortz, as he is experienced enough in playing treacherous villains.</p><h2><span id=Personal_life>Personal life</span></h2><p>As of 2020, Mahesh hasn’t revealed any information about his private life, and nothing is known about his former or current affairs. He was rumored to date a Serbian actress and model, Mili Stankovic, but Mahesh hasn’t confirmed this information.</p><h2><span id=Hobbies_favorite_things_and_interesting_facts>Hobbies, favorite things and interesting facts</span></h2><p>Mahesh is a Buddhist. He writes mantras in his school-like notebook; his favorite mantra is ‘May all being in the world be happy’, which he writes it line by line a hundred times. Mahesh likes <u><a rel=nofollow href=#>cats</a></u>, dogs and other animals, and even <u><a rel=nofollow href=#>posted</a> </u>a video on his Instagram account in which he found a small white rat in the Szechuan streets and stopped by to pat it. As a convinced vegetarian, he supported the author of the book “Eating Animals”, Jonathan Safran Foer, <u><a rel=nofollow href=#>writing</a></u> that a conscious person would never eat meat and support the meat industry.</p><p>https://twitter.com/MaheshJadu/status/633401118018666496</p><p>He also supported the author of the movie “Cowspiracy: The Sustainability Secret” (2014), and personally Leonardo DiCaprio for editing the story and making another version of the movie in 2015. Clearly Mahesh is an activist, fighting for the rights of the animals, and cares a lot about the impact of animal agriculture. Mahesh likes travelling; he’s visited Venice, Italy, and even filmed a short movie about his discovery of the hidden corners of the city. Mahesh likes Italian cuisine – one of his favorite dishes in a vegetarian pizza.</p><h2><span id=Appearance_clothing_style>Appearance, clothing style</span></h2><p>Mahesh has dark-brown hair and hazel eyes. One of his special appearance features is his right brow – Mahesh has a thin scar in the middle of it, which divides his brow into two parts.</p><p>He sports a short beard and moustache, is 6ft (1.83m) tall and weighs around 180lbs (82kgs). As to his clothing style, he likes wearing casual looks, preferring neutral colors such as brown, beige, black and white, and various styles of hat.</p><h2><span id=Net_worth_and_salary>Net worth and salary</span></h2><p>As of early 2020, Mahesh has accumulated a net worth of $1 million. Mahesh works hard as an actor, producer and screenwriter. He is signed to several future projects, such as the second season of “The Witcher” series coming up in 2021, and the western of Australian director Roderick MacKay entitled “The Furnace”, in which Mahesh has landed the role of Sadhu, so his net worth will certainly continue to grow.</p>, <a href=#>Wikipedia</a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCpnZSerm%2B70aBmraCVYsKvwM6lm2asoqrBqXnOn2SvoZycsqe70a2xZqeeYsGpsYywoK2bmJq%2FbrnAoZysoF2frqXBjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./10081826-nba-rumors-knicks-have-firm-stance-on-price-in-damian-lillard-james-harden-trades.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="NBA Rumors: Knicks Have Firm Stance on Price in Damian Lillard, James Harden Trades | News, Scores, ">&larr;
