But was his own education a success or failure?</p><p><strong>After graduating from the </strong><a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Crossroads School for Arts and Sciences</strong></a><strong> in Santa Monica, Jack Black attended UCLA. While studying here, he joined the theatre group, The Actors’ Gang, and met Kyle Gass. Together they would go on to form Tenacious D, a successful comedy rock duo. His academic career was short-lived, however, when he dropped out of college in his sophomore year.&nbsp;</strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram"></figure><p>So what made Jack Black leave such a prestigious university as <a href=# rel=noopener>UCLA</a>? Read on to find out.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Why did Jack Black drop out of college?</h2><p>In a commencement speech for graduating students at the Montverde Academy, Jack Black admits that he “slept through the whole…college…thing”.&nbsp;</p><p>He also says it is ‘super expensive, super hard…and is a waste of time and money unless you want to be a doctor’. You can view the speech in its entirety below.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>Of course this speech has a very comedic undertone. Further in his speech he even states, “Do not listen to me. I don’t know jack diddly squat about nothing”.&nbsp;</p><p>Yet this is not the only time that Jack Black has spoken of college as being something that wasn’t really for him.&nbsp;</p><p>He recalls in <a href=# rel=noopener>this interview with Parade Magazine</a> that his main motivations for attending college were to further his acting career and to please his father.</p><p>“I didn’t really have a lot of [acting] prospects coming out of high school. I needed a place to make some connections. College was very important to my father. I was trying to make him happy. And I thought UCLA could lead to a career”.</p><p>Jack Black has indeed had a very successful career since leaving UCLA.</p><p>He has been nominated for two <a href=# rel=noopener>Golden Globes</a> and achieved the ultimate Hollywood accolade, when he was honored with a star on the <a href=# rel=noopener>Hollywood Walk of Fame</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How did Jack Black become successful after quitting college?</h2><p>So after only two years at UCLA, how did Jack Black go on to find such success in acting?&nbsp;</p><p>His involvement with The Actors’ Gang certainly helped. <a href=# rel=noopener>Tim Robbins</a>, one of the original founders of the performance troupe, decided to cast Jack in his first film role with a small part in the political satire ‘<a href=# rel=noopener>Bob Roberts</a>’.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>In <a href=# rel=noopener>this interview with GQ magazine</a>, Jack recalls his feelings after attending the premiere of the movie at the Cannes Film Festival. While he was there he went to a party hosted by Robert Altman and recalls it was;</p><p>“Just a showbiz cream dream delu. I smoked a joint with Altman and some other fucking dudes. It doesn’t get much more stony glamorous. I remember thinking, This is the beginning. And then…nothing”.</p><p>In the following years he managed to pick up several other ‘bit parts’ before he was cast opposite John Cusack in the romantic comedy movie ‘<a href=# rel=noopener>High Fidelity</a>’. In a video interview with GQ magazine which you can watch below, Jack suggests this was his “breakthrough role”.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>He also mentions that he believes he got the part because “John Cusack was a fan of my band, Tenacious D”, the band he founded with Kyle Gass at UCLA.</p><p>However, it wasn’t until the ‘School of Rock’ that Jack really hit the limelight.</p><p>He played Dewey Finn, a failed wannabe rockstar who lies his way into a job as a substitute teacher at a prestigious school. For this role Jack won not only critical acclaim, but a Golden Globe nomination.&nbsp;</p><p>He describes it in the previously mentioned GQ magazine interview as “the movie I’m most proud of. That’s the one when all the planets aligned”.</p><p>Many other movies and a further Golden Globe nomination followed for his role in the movie ‘<a href=# rel=noopener>Bernie</a>’. Tenacious D have continued to tour and perform. Jack Black has continued to find success.</p><p>Would any of this have happened if Jack Black hadn’t have gone to college, even though he dropped out in the end? To that question, there is no answer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jp2gnWWalrCsecGlmJyjXZy8bsDOZpqopJyatKZ7</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./womens-world-cup-philippines-switzerland-match-summary-3fcbe651244210dd1652ff717f463e88.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Switzerland beats Philippines 2-0 in its FIFA Women's World Cup opener">&larr;
