In 2022, he was announced to appear in a leading role on Went Up The Hill.</strong></p><p>Dacre Montgomery is a 43 year-old Australian actor born on 22nd November 1994. He started his acting career in 2011 at the age of 17 and has today earned a good spot in the list of successful actors in Hollywood. He has starred in a good number of successful movies although he is most popular for his role as Billy Hargrove in Stranger Things.</p><h2><strong>Dacre Montgomery’s Acting Career Kicked Off in 2011</strong></h2><p>Dacre Montgomery was born and raised in Perth, Western Australia, and there he attended Mount Lawley Senior High School. Thanks to his parents, Judith Barrett-Lennard and Scott Montgomery-Harvey, who worked in the screen industry in Australia, Dacre started performing in theatre and on-screen at the age of nine.</p><p>Thus, he developed a great passion for acting and already made up his mind to pursue it as a career after his education. When he was 12, one of his fellow students voted for him to be “The most likely student to become a Hollywood star” in the annual yearbook. Meanwhile, reports show that Dacre is not very good at academics but was more passionate about acting.</p><p>However, he continued with his studies in the dramatic arts in his senior years. After high school, Dacre enrolled at the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAAPA) and completed a three-year course. He then proceeded to Edith Cowan University where he earned his acting degree in 2015. Upon graduation, Montgomery landed his first movie role in the short film Betrand the Terrible where he portrayed the character of Fred.</p><p>Following that, he appeared in a television pilot called Family Tree. Dacre played minor roles in a few other movies and TV shows and with his few years of acting experience and skills, he was able to perfectly portray his roles. Yet, he didn’t get the fame he desired. That notwithstanding, he kept on putting in effort and hard work to better his skills.</p><h3><strong>He First Came to Public Recognition With His Role in Power Rangers</strong></h3><p>Although he has previously been acting, Dacre Montgomery first became a public face following his appearance in Power Rangers, a 2017 American superhero film. In the movie, he portrayed the character of Jason Scott, the leader of Power Rangers. The movie follows the story of a group of teenagers who gained newfound powers and must use them to protect Earth from a primeval reawakened threat.</p><p>Against a production budget of &nbsp;$100-105 million, Power Rangers grossed a worldwide $142.3 million. In critical response, it received mixed reviews from several critics and Dacre’s role was well received by the viewing audience. The movie was nominated in six categories at the 2017 Teen Choice Awards and Dacre was nominated for Choice Sci-Fi Movie Actor.</p><p>With Power Rangers, Dacre was opportune to share the screen with notable and long-established actors like Bryan Cranston, Elizabeth Banks, Naomi Scott, Bill Hader, and others. After Power Ranger, Dacre began to get more opportunities and opened doors to land more big roles in movies. He made his next onscreen appearance in the same year, 2017 in the Australian comedy A Few Best Men and its sequel, A Few Less Men, Godot’s Clinic, and Better Watch Out.</p><h3><strong>Dacre Montgomery Got His Breakthrough Role in Stranger Things</strong></h3><p>Just in the same year (2017) he starred in Power Rangers, Dacre Montgomery got his breakthrough role after he joined the cast for the second season of the American science fiction horror drama television series, Stranger Things. The series which currently has 4 seasons and 34 episodes was first released on Netflix on 15th July 2016 and in February 2022, it was renewed for its fifth and final season which is yet to be announced.</p><p>Stranger Things centers around the residents of the fictional small town of Hawkins, Indiana, who were afflicted with a hostile alternate dimension known as the Upside Down. In the series, Dacre appeared as Billy Hargrove, Max’s unpredictable, violent, and abusive older stepbrother who challenges Steve’s (Joe Keery) popularity.</p><p>In 2019, he returned for the same role in season 3, and in 2022 for a guest role in its season 4. Stranger Things has so far received numerous awards, recognition, and nominations across the world, and its cast winning several awards as well. Stranger Things is Dacre Montgomery’s first and so far only TV role and he has indeed gathered huge success with it. And considering his successful role in it, he has simply set the bar so high.</p><h2><strong>What Movie is Dacre Montgomery Most Famous for?</strong></h2><p>As stated earlier, Dacre Montgomery is most famous for Stranger Things and Power Rangers. His roles in the film and TV show undoubtedly put him in the limelight and announced him to a wider audience. While Stranger Things is still ongoing, Dacre has not slowed down a bit in his career but has kept on bagging other roles in other projects.</p><p>In 2019, he appeared in The True History of the Kelly Gang, a film based on the novel of the same title by Peter Carey where starred alongside Nicholas Hoult and Russell Crowe. His most recent role is in The Broken Hearts Gallery where he played the character of Nick. On 19th October 2022, Dacre was announced to play a leading role in Went Up The Hill, a film written and directed by Samuel Van Grinsven.</p><p>Dacre released his own podcast titled “DKMH” on 11th July 2019. The description of the podcast which features his own poetry exposes Dacre’s musical journey and states that he spent two years compiling his own poetry and getting “wonderfully talented” artists to help him “bring it to life”.</p><h2><strong>List of Dacre Montgomery’s Movies and TV Shows</strong></h2><p><strong>Movies</strong></p><ul><li>2011 – Betrand the Terrible Fred</li><li>2015 – Tryptophan Jake</li><li>2015 – Godot’s Clinic Barnabus Stottle</li><li>2017 – Power Rangers Jason Scott / Red Ranger</li><li>2017 – A Few Less Men Mike</li><li>2017 – Better Watch Out Jeremy</li><li>2020 – The Broken Hearts Gallery Nick Danielson</li><li>2022 – Elvis Steve Binder</li></ul><p><strong>TV Shows</strong></p><ul><li>2017 – 2022 Stranger Things Billy Hargrove</li></ul><p>In addition to acting, Dacre Montgomery has been featured in a number of music videos.
