His car is currently sixteen years old, but Rowe still loves riding it.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I don’t <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">#collect</a> things. I definitely don’t collect cars. My current vehicle is fourteen years old, and acting like it. But if I did, and if I could somehow bring myself to write checks for things I don’t need, this would get my attention. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">#rockfordfiles</a> <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/G42TsnA1EK</a></p><p>— The Real Mike Rowe (@mikeroweworks) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">January 17, 2019</a></p><p>So, it seems like Mike is not a materialistic person.
