Most of the others in Birmingham had gone by the early 1970s, but the ones in Wake Green Road just clung on.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In 1998, the 16 council-owned units in Moseley were awarded Grade II-Listed status – giving them extra protection in terms of future redevelopment.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Birmingham City Council have conducted some works since, replacing&nbsp;<span style=font-size:16px>windows, fitting central heating and upgrading appliances – but much of the properties’ original features remain unchanged.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span style=font-size:16px>Plans are currently in the works to restore the pre-fab homes, though the council says it needs to source additional funding to help fund the project.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to the Pre-fab Museum, an archive which holds information about post-war prefabs, their history and design, say there are around 8,000 left in the UK today.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>However they say many have had new roofs and windows and so nowadays look more like bungalows.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>One expert told MailOnline that nearly all of the Swedish timber post-war prefabs – many of which were built in rural areas – are still up and accounted for.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘There’s no problem keeping it warm.

It was strange when I first moved in,’ says Ms Grattan.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I remember sitting on the wall across the road and looking over here and someone saying, ‘I think that’s the home the council has got you’.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I looked at it and I said ‘no, I’m not living there’. It was a shock. But I moved in and I spent a lot of money doing it all up.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I had to have the whole thing rewired. There were pipes sticking out everywhere.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘A man lived here before me and he had pulled one of the walls down, so I had to put that back up.

The council put me a shower in but I’m pretty sure all the others have got baths. I think it’s lovely.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Ms Grattan pays £96 per week for her one-storey home and says it’s worth every penny – but there’s one thing she’d like to change. ‘The only thing I don’t like is the toilet,’ she says. ‘It’s like an airplane toilet, it’s so small.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Pub supervisor Lucy Burkett, 24, lives with her boyfriend in the only privately-owned prefab on the street.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I’d never seen somewhere like this in my life,’ says Lucy. ‘I didn’t know anything about the history when we moved in.</p><img decoding=async id=i-1a4fcca5bcbb19ab src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/16/16/54273539-10518585-Ann_Gardener_84_has_lived_on_Wake_Green_Road_for_18_years-m-84_1645028774836.jpg height=587 width=470 alt="Ann Gardener, 84, has lived on Wake Green Road for 18 years" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p></p><img decoding=async id=i-5fc0306f69504638 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2022/02/16/16/54273529-10518585-She_said_For_the_whole_time_I_have_been_here_Birmingham_City_Cou-a-85_1645028781883.jpg height=587 width=470 alt="She said: 'For the whole time I have been here, Birmingham City Council has visited us once in the last 18 years.
