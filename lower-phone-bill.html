However, if you're like most Americans, you're paying an arm and a leg for those services every month. According to the latest statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2018, Americans <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>spent an average of $99 a month</a>—or a whopping $1,188 per year—on their cell phone service. That doesn't mean you have to keep paying through the nose for this essential utility, however—in fact, there's a simple way to cut your cell phone bill significantly, according to experts.</p><p>If you want to keep more money in your pocket, finance expert <strong>Ethan Taub</strong>, CEO of personal finance sites <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Billry</a> and <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Debtry</a>, says that signing up for a new group plan with friends or family members can help you significantly reduce your monthly bill. "If you band together with five or more, you can use the power of people to strike a deal with one of the providers," says Taub.</p><p>"Locking that many clients into one provider will allow you room to negotiate and get the best deals they've got," he explains. In fact, 12 of Taub's own employees banded together to get&nbsp; a group discount and managed to score a 50 percent reduction on advertised rates from a major carrier.</p><p>But teaming up with a big group isn't the only way to lower your bill—read on to discover more easy ways to lower your phone bill every month. And for more ways to keep more cash in your wallet, this is <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>The Best Way to Save Money While Shopping Online, According to Experts</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/01/wifi-signal.jpg><p>If your data usage is eating up a huge amount of your cell phone bill, there's an easy solution you can use almost anywhere. "Whether you're in or out of [your] home, always opt to use wifi when possible, as data usage via the internet doesn't count toward your monthly data cap," says consumer expert <strong>Dana Marineau</strong>, CMO of savings app <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Rakuten</a>. Luckily, you can find free wifi almost anywhere these days, from Starbucks to Whole Foods to your local public library.

Marineau recommends analyzing your phone usage and researching what other cell plans offer in terms of service.</p><p>"Depending on how much time you spend talking on the phone or how much data you use, you can save roughly $200+ each year just by switching your phone plan to better fit your lifestyle," Marineau explains.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/05/phone-call-man.jpg><p>If your cell phone plan is with a major carrier, consider switching to a smaller company and you might just <span data-href=https://bestlifeonline.com/ways-to-bring-down-a-c-bill/ data-target=_blank data-rel="noopener noreferrer">get a smaller bill</span>, too.</p><p>"Don't forget to check lesser-known carriers like Consumer Cellular and Republic Wireless—they all offer different plans and pricing, so you'll likely find competitive deals," says Marineau.

"By speaking with a representative from your phone carrier, they may be able to waive certain fees or charges, or offer recommendations on different plans and special promotions," she says.

He adds that doing this for a family or group plan can save you even more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/08/school-nurses-at-table.jpg><p>Depending on your career path, you may already be eligible for a discount on your phone bill.</p><p>"If you're a veteran, nurse, teacher, first responder, or even a student, each cell phone company has a simple verification process" that can help you score employment-based discounts, according to personal finance instructor <strong>Frankie Fegurgur</strong>, founder of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Frank Money Talk</a>. Fegurgur explains that these discounts can often save you as much as 10 percent on your bill every month, and that they may make you eligible for savings on phones, accessories, and activation fees, too.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/05/phone-call.jpg><p>However, you don't have to work for someone else to get in on those savings.</p><p>"If your lines are through a business that you own, you typically qualify for discounts similar to corporate employees," says Fegurgur. Signing up through your small business can also get you access to a dedicated sales rep and business-specific customer service.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/man-bills.jpg><p>If you're over 65, you may be eligible for big savings on your phone plan.</p><p>"There are wireless carriers who specialize in lower cost plans" for seniors, Fegurgur explains. "You can contact them online or over the phone, and can help you transfer your existing phone number."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/young-black-man-paying-bills.jpg><p>If you're willing to pay up front for your phone bill, you can likely keep more cash in your wallet by doing so.</p><p>"Postpaid always costs more than prepaid," says financial advisor <strong>James Walsh</strong>, CEO of <a rel="noopener noreferrer external" href=#>Billions in the Bank</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/04/middle-aged-hispanic-woman-computer-call.jpg><p>If you haven't ever needed to use your phone insurance—or forgot you were paying for it in the first place—it may be time to give it up. Walsh says that ditching insurance is an easy way to save money every month without giving up any valuable services you're actually using.
