Meanwhile, without official confirmation, a few sites have reported him dead.&nbsp;George McGinnis is a former National Basketball Association (NBA) professional basketball player.</p><p>He attended Indiana University before transferring to Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI).&nbsp;He rose to fame as a result of his extraordinary abilities on the court, notably his scoring and rebounding abilities.&nbsp;McGinnis had a great professional career in both the American Basketball Association (ABA) and the National Basketball Association (NBA). In 1971, he started his professional career with the Indiana Pacers of the ABA.&nbsp;George was instrumental in the Pacers capturing the ABA title in 1972-1973. He was a three-time ABA All-Star and twice named to the All-ABA Team.</p><p>McGinnis resumed his NBA career after the ABA-NBA merger in 1976. He played with the Philadelphia 76ers, Denver Nuggets, and Indiana Pacers, among others.&nbsp;McGinnis was a two-time NBA All-Star who was recognized for his scoring and rebounding talents.&nbsp;In 2017, the NBA great was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame for his accomplishments in the sport. His influence on both the ABA and the NBA solidified his position as one of the most significant players in professional basketball history.</p><h2>George McGinnis Illnesses And Health</h2><p><strong>George McGinnis</strong> had a difficult opponent off the court in the last chapter of his spectacular basketball career – not a basketball opponent, but a chronic health condition damaging his once-strong physique. This narrative started in 2017, just before he was about to have back surgery when he was inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame.&nbsp;He was hesitant to make this choice until his wife, Lynda, who was facing a terminal illness, pushed him to do so.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/George-McGinnis-1.jpg alt="George McGinnis" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>McGinnis was in recovery by early 2021, using a walker instead of his muscular strides.&nbsp;Despite these physical obstacles, he showed persistence by training regularly with former Pacers trainer David Craig to reclaim some of his athletic ability. McGinnis had a huge athletic obstacle in managing life without help as a result of spinal stenosis, a hereditary ailment exacerbated by his 11 seasons of professional basketball. It was not an easy choice to undergo surgery, particularly after a previous infection. Dr. David Schwartz, on the other hand, proposed a potential approach employing titanium discs to straighten and strengthen McGinnis’ spine.</p><p>The procedure took nine hours one day and seven hours three days later, with a few days in the hospital for recuperation.&nbsp;McGinnis, determined to regain his previous self, visited with Dr. Schwartz on October 31, 2021, in preparation for surgery later that year.&nbsp;The city was anticipating the return of one of its sporting icons with bated breath. McGinnis expressed hope for a future in which his physique will mirror the power and elegance of his basketball days.&nbsp;As a result, the scene was set for a victorious comeback, a sign of victory over physical hurdles.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/George-McGinnis.jpg alt="George McGinnis" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>What Was the Cause of His Death?</h2><p>According to reports as of December 8, 2023, the Indiana basketball great has had a significant health problem.&nbsp;George McGinnis has been on life support for three days, according to information provided on Only The Ball Was Brown’s Facebook page.&nbsp;Despite social media claims, there has been no official confirmation of his death; his current state is unknown.&nbsp;The situation seems to be precarious, and people close to McGinnis are waiting for further information on his status.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGienqeinLJuucKgoKemmah6pK3UrJxmp5Zisaat06FksKCRqXqprc%2BpnKedlGLBsHnHoqRmoJWWubW0jJqlnWWZobmvsdKsZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./richest-celebrities.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mike Rowe Net Worth  Multiple Income And Earning Sources">&larr;
