The 49-year-old lady is obviously an American by nationality, however, her physical appearance is a testament to her African-American origin.</p><p>Tamika hasn’t breathed a word about her parents, thus their names and professions are not known. However, it is common knowledge that she spent her growing up years alongside an older sister who goes by the name Tonya Muldrow.</p><p>Tonya is now the wife of one of Wu-Tang Clan’s founding members, Lamont Jody Hawkins.</p><h3><strong>Tamika Smith’s Education</strong></h3><p>Growing up in her place of birth, Staten Island, Tamika Smith achieved her earliest academic qualifications there. The quest to acquire a higher degree took her to Oneonta Job Corps to study nursing between 1991 and 1992.</p><p>Obviously, Tamika abandoned her nursing certificate to go try her hands in another field; this time, she opted to join Richmond County Real Estate Institute where she underwent training to become a real estate salesperson in 2012.</p><p>By 2013, Tamika decided to earn a degree in entrepreneurial and small business operations which led her to enroll at the College of Staten Island. Within the same period, the New Yorker tried to acquire an Associate Degree in the field of Business Management and Administration.</p><h2><strong>What does Method Man’s Wife do for a Living?</strong></h2><p>Tamika Smith’s LinkedIn profile described her as a small business owner, however, she put in several years of paid employment before going to establish her own business concern.</p><p>Launching her career in the late 1990s, Tamika started working for a company called Method Man Entertainment. One interesting fact about the firm is that it is owned by the man who would later become her husband and she functioned as his personal assistant. The New Yorker stayed with the entertainment company for the ensuing five years till 2002.</p><p>In 2007, she went to spend one year with SIDDSO (Staten Island Developmental Disabilities Services Office) where she took care of adults with learning and physical disabilities as a caretaker and developmental aid.</p><p>After she took the decision to quit paid employment and launch her own firm, Tamika Smith joined the beauty industry and is now the proud owner of a small business, though the nature of the services she renders is not known.</p><p>Tamika’s life has always been conducted in private. She only started attracting public attention after she hooked up with the famous American rapper, Method Man.</p><p>When she is not busy with work, Tamika said she loves to study real estate, spend quality family time with her folks, and watch football.</p><h2><strong>When Did Tamika Smith and Method Man Meet?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/05/R-10-e1683998490650.jpg><p>As earlier mentioned, Tamika Smith first crossed paths with the man who would become her husband during the 1990s at Method Man Entertainment and he was none other than the owner.</p><p>Though they met earlier, it was not love at first sight for the couple as they were obviously not in a hurry to start a relationship. Meth and Tamika went on to launch their relationship after a couple of years while she was still his employee.</p><p>During her time with Method Man Entertainment, Tamika witnessed her love interest thrive in the business, as he became one of the top names in the industry. By the time 1999 came, the love birds were madly in love and well secured in their relationship and were already parents to three lovely children.</p><p>Meth saw it as the right time to take their relationship a notch higher and popped the big question to Tamika Smith to which he received a “yes”.</p><h2><strong>She Has Been Method Man’s Wife Since 2001</strong></h2><p>Following their official engagement, Tamika and Smith did not rush to exchange wedding vows, they for another two years before finalizing things.</p><p>Their wedding eventually took place on the 3rd of March 2001, however, they didn’t bother to make the details public. Thus, their wedding venue, guest list, and the type of ceremony they had are not known. Despite the fact that she became Meth’s wife in 2001, Tamika continued working with the entertainment company until she finally quit in 2002.</p><p>The couple’s union has endured for 22 long years and still going strong. According to Method Man, though they have been officially married for over two decades, he has been with Tamika for close to three decades. The American rapper was on the Red Carpet Talk when he revealed this to Jada Pinkett Smith.</p><p>Meth ended his talk by saying that marriage actually works but respect has to be first and foremost. Coming from a man who loves to keep his personal life under lock and key, it was indeed a rare reveal.</p><h3><strong>Tamika’s Husband is a Renowned Rapper</strong></h3><p>Method Man is known as one of the top rap artists in the American hip-hop scene. He has also made a name as a record label producer, songwriter, and actor. Born on the 2nd of March 1971, Meth is a New York native with the given name, Clifford Smith, Jr. He only started Using Method Man as a stage name when he became a musician.</p><p>Though Tamika Smith’s husband also goes solo from time to time, he is best known as one of the founding members of the renowned East Coast hip-hop group called Wu-Tang Clan. His time with the music group saw him release a total of four gold studio albums and they equally made four platinum studio albums.</p><p>After he collaborated with singer Mary J. Blige in 1995 to release the track, I’ll Be There for You/You’re All I Need to Get By, the American rap artist bagged a Grammy Award in the category of “Best Rap Performance By A Duo”</p><p>In addition to the success he has recorded in the music industry, Method Man can also hold his own in the acting scene. He is known for playing roles on both the big and small screens, some of his best-known movies include, How High, Red Tails, and The Cobbler and he has appeared in shows like Law and Order: SVU, including the 2020 horror series entitled Vampire vs. The Bronx.</p><p>Alongside Mary J. Blige, Meth is set to appear in Power Book II: Ghost – the Starz spinoff series where they will be depicting the characters Davis Maclean and Monet Stewart.</p><h2><strong>How many kids does Tamika Smith Have?</strong></h2><p>Even though she loves to live her life away from the public, it is common knowledge that Tamika Smith is a mother to three children with her spouse, Method Man. One interesting part of her motherhood tale is that they already had all her kids before they decided to put a ring on their relationship.</p><p>Because of their secretive life, the exact birthdates of all Tamika’s children are not known and nothing has been said about their place of birth. Her children are Shakuan <strong>“</strong>Sha” Smith, Rae (Raekwon) Smith, and Cheyenne Smith. Cheyenne and Rae are twins born in 1997 and their big brother, Sha was born in 1996.</p><p>The reason Tamika is not always talking about her brood is that she wants to keep them protected, but she shares a great bond with them</p><p>Method Man for one has shown that he is a hands-on father. He once revealed in an interview session on Red Table Talk that becoming a father made him go all out to improve the image he presents to the world.</p><p>According to the rap artist, a father who has children of school age surely needs to be more discreet in the kind of behavior he puts up in the public space. Even if you know your kids’ teacher and they see how dedicated you are towards the children’s wellbeing, no one is likely to take you seriously if all they ever get to hear are tales of you always being high. Meth said he no longer put weed at the forefront again and he did it all for his children.</p><p>The Smith children are all in their twenties and forging their own paths in life. Sha played football during his student days but is currently following in the footsteps of his dad as a musician. He performs under the stage names, PXWER or Father Sha. In fact, he even collaborated with Meth on a song.</p><p>Rae is also a footballer and in 2017, he started playing for the Penn State football team. Cheyenne acts as a cheerleader for the Wagner Seahawks and is on her way to becoming a social media star. The Smith family are residents of Staten Island, New York.</p><h2><strong>Tamika is a Cancer Survivor</strong></h2><p>Sometime in 2006, Tamika Smith was diagnosed with cancer of the breast. The diagnosis came as a huge shock to the American music superstar and his wife, thus, they decided to hide it from their family and friends.</p><p>Tamika wasted no time in commencing treatment and although the family never deemed it necessary to release the details of her treatment, words got out that Meth’s wife beat cancer, went into remission, and has long been declared cancer free.</p><h3><strong>Tamika’s Cancer Triggered a Feud Between Her Family and Radio Presenter, Wendy Williams</strong></h3><p>It would appear that choosing to live her life away from prying eyes didn’t save Tamika from experiencing the troubles of celebrity life.</p><p>It wasn’t long after her cancer was diagnosed before the news got out. It only took the likes of presenter Wendy Williams to get wind of the situation for it to become public knowledge. On the set of her WBLS radio show, Wendy told the whole world that Meth’s wife has been diagnosed with breast cancer and she did it without seeking consent from either of the duo.</p><p>Needless to say, the announcement didn’t go down well with Method Man. Because he couldn’t deny it any longer, Meth had to admit that the disclosure was true but it was totally inappropriate for Wendy to go on the radio and announce something they have been keeping private and confidential.</p><p>The situation bred a rift between Meth and Wendy. Talking to Rolling Stone in an interview session, the American rap artist said he wanted the radio host to feel what he felt sitting down in a hospital room and watch them pump what he referred to as “poison” into your loved one. In that same interview, Meth said Tamika is among the strongest woman on the entire planet</p><p>To put a halt to such a situation happening again, Tamika Smith’s husband decided to tighten security around his personal life, he doesn’t let even an inkling out in public.</p><h3><strong>The Couple’s Enduring Marriage was Once Threatened by the Same Wendy Williams</strong></h3><p>After Wendy spilled the beans about Tamika’s cancer diagnosis, a lot of speculations started making the rounds on the internet space. There are people who claimed that the media personality only got to hear the information about the diagnosis from Meth and it happened because they were secret lovers.</p><p>Note, it wasn’t the first time that Tamika Smith’s husband has been accused of having an extramarital affair. There were even people claiming that the American rapper has fathered some kids outside his marriage. However, Method Man is yet to confirm or refute any of these.</p><p>No one knows why Wendy targeted the Smith family again in 2021 when she came all out to confirm the rumors about her illicit affair with Meth. According to what the presenter told DJ Suss One in an interview session, she smoked weed with Meth one wild night at the club. A gunfight suddenly ensued and they were watching when the cops came in. Meth and his whole Clan left Staten Island in a car and she met up with them. Wendy said she rocked her shoulders and batted her eyes at Meth and asked if he wanted to come over and he replied “Yeah”.</p><p>They eventually ended up at her penthouse where they had a one-night stand while she gave him a bath, Wendy also insinuated that Meth may deny her claims or maybe not.</p><p>Important to note that Wendy has become notorious for gossiping about celebrities and on several occasions, fans have called her out for her ugly deeds. The presenter’s audience once booed her on her own show.</p><h3><strong>Tamika Smith’s Response to Wendy Williams</strong></h3><p>Under normal circumstances, Tamika Smith wouldn’t comment on public talks but Wendy’s behavior sparked a strong response from the mother of three. Tamika took to Instagram to call the radio presenter out, saying she has always preferred to ignore her lies in the past, but the presenter has proved herself to be totally incapable of decency. She accused Wendy of being obsessed with her family and she is tired of her antics.</p><p>Talking further, the cancer survivor said Wendy never cared that she was violating her right to privacy and there was also the fact that she was yet to share the details of her health condition with family and close friends.</p><p>Getting back at Williams, Tamika Smith mocked her divorce from Kevin Hunter saying he followed another woman and left Wendy. In her tirade, the mother of three described Wendy as a woman whose career is surviving on life support with very low ratings on all her projects. She is just desperate for attention, Tamika said, and has decided to leverage Meth’s fame to put her name on the trending list once more.</p><p>Acknowledging that Williams was once respected in the world of entertainment, Tamika said she has succeeded in reducing herself to what she described as “a tabloid side note and circus freak!”</p><p>In conclusion, Tamika Smith assured Wendy that her union with Meth is solid, his career continues to be successful, and Williams will remain a miserable bitch on planet Earth. “Ugly inside and outside,” Tamika dubbed Wendy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMGiucikmGarnZ7BqXnIrGSmnaSdvKV5zJqlrGWnnrOmec6fZKiulad6c3yMspyaqqNiuqax02afnqpf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./radonda-vaught-wikipedia-testimony-hearing-sentence.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Radonda Vaught Wikipedia Testimony Hearing &amp;amp; Sentence: Husband Age Gap -Family, Who Are They?">&larr;
